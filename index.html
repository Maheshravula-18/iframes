<h5><p>This recipe will tell you how easy it is to make the best Mutton Pulao. Usually, people think that Chicken Pulao is easier to make and shy away from Mutton Pulao. But I would say it all depends on the method and this recipe is a good example for a simple process and great results.
I call it the best Mutton Pulao because it can be made with ingredients that you have handy and will always get a uniform taste.</p></h5>
<br>
<h2>TIPS:-</h2>
<OL>
<li>The Mutton cooks faster if the meat is tender and the Pulao then becomes tastier.</li>
<li> If the Mutton is washed and marinated in some Water with 2 tsp Salt, then it cooks faster</li>
<li>The Water used to cook Mutton will still remain after cooking.</li>
<li>Add some more Water adequate for the Rice to cook , It has to be slightly more than the Rice. </li>
<li> If I take 1.5 Cups of Rice, we need 2 Cups of Water. This includes the Mutton stock remaining.</li>
<li>If you are using Sona Masuri Rice, then make it 2.5 Cups of water for 1.5 Cups of Rice. Cook to two whistles and then rest it for 20 minutes after the stove is switched off.</OL>

 <em><p>Mutton biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish made with tender pieces of marinated mutton, basmati rice, and a blend of spices. The meat is cooked slowly to absorb the flavors of ingredients like ginger, garlic, and garam masala. Saffron or turmeric adds a rich golden color to the rice, while fried onions, fresh herbs, and yogurt enhance its taste. Often cooked using the dum method, the dish is sealed and steamed for a perfect balance of flavors. It is traditionally served with raita, salad, or boiled eggs. </em></p>
